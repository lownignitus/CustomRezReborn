# CustomRezv2
## Background

While looking for another addon, I found this old abandoned project. I decided to fork it to 1. update it so could test and play with it, and 2. to learn from it things that I wanted to know for addon I was looking for. I am not sure if I will load this to Curse when I am finished, but all credit goes to the Original author Fannia.
